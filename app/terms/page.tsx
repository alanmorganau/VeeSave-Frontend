              These Terms of Use (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your access to and use of the VeeSave web and mobile
              applications, our early-access pilot, and any related services (the &quot;Services&quot;). By creating an

            </h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              VeeSave is operated by VeeSave Pty Ltd, an Australian company. The Services are currently designed
              primarily for users located in Australia. References to &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot; mean the
              individual or organisation using the Services.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Your lawyers should confirm the correct company details, registered office address, and any overseas
              entities involved before this text is published to end users.

              3. Not financial, tax, or legal advice
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              VeeSave helps you organise and understand vehicle-related expenses, trips, and compliance information.
              The outputs you see in the app — including dashboards, reports, and projections — are for information
              only and are based on the data you provide.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              VeeSave does <span className="font-semibold">not</span> provide financial, taxation, or legal advice, and
              you should not rely on the Services as a substitute for professional advice. You are responsible for
              seeking independent accounting, tax, or legal advice (for example, in relation to ATO requirements or
              motor vehicle deduction rules).

            </h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services complies with applicable laws and any
              policies or obligations that apply to you (for example, fleet policies, employment contracts, or finance
              agreements). You must keep your login credentials secure and notify us promptly of any suspected
              unauthorised access to your account.

              You are responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and legality of the information you enter into
              VeeSave, including vehicle data, trip logs, fuel receipts, and other expenses. Where you upload or enter
              information about third parties (such as drivers, employees, or contractors), you warrant that you have
              obtained any necessary consents and authorisations required by law.

            </h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              VeeSave is intended to help users manage costs and compliance; it is not an in-vehicle safety system.
              The Services should not be used while driving, and you must comply with all applicable road rules and
              workplace health and safety requirements.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Any references to vehicle condition, maintenance status, or risk are based on the data you supply and do

              fleets or heavy vehicles.

              During the early-access pilot, VeeSave may be provided on a complimentary or discounted basis under
              specific arrangements agreed with participating users or organisations. Any future subscription plans,
              pricing, and billing terms should be documented here by your legal and commercial teams before launch.

            </h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Nothing in these draft Terms is intended to exclude, restrict, or modify any rights or remedies you may
              have under the <span className="font-semibold">Australian Consumer Law (ACL)</span> or other non-excludable
              laws. To the extent permitted by law, and subject to those non-excludable rights, VeeSave is provided
              &quot;as is&quot; and we do not guarantee that the Services will be error-free or uninterrupted.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Your lawyers should confirm that all mandatory ACL wording and any required disclosures for SaaS, fleet,
              or automotive services are included in the final version of these Terms.

              9. Limitations of liability (draft concept)
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Subject always to non-excludable consumer guarantees, the intention is that VeeSave&apos;s liability to
              you in connection with the Services would be limited to: (a) where the Services are not of a kind
              ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic, or household use or consumption, the resupply of the Services
              or the cost of resupply; and (b) otherwise, the minimum extent permitted by law.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              The exact limitation of liability, exclusions, and caps must be drafted and approved by qualified legal
              counsel to reflect VeeSave&apos;s risk appetite and the final commercial model.

            </h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              We may suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to the Services where reasonably necessary — for
              example, to protect the security or integrity of the platform, respond to misuse, or comply with law.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Your lawyers should refine and extend this section to cover notice requirements, export of data on
              termination, and any post-termination obligations on both parties.

            </h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Because VeeSave is in active development, features and functionality may change over time. We may update
              these Terms to reflect new features, pilot arrangements, or legal requirements. In a production
              environment, we would give you reasonable notice of material changes in line with legal advice.

              12. Governing law and disputes
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              It is anticipated that these Terms will be governed by the laws of Australia and the laws of the state or
              territory in which VeeSave Pty Ltd is registered, and that any disputes would be subject to the
              jurisdiction of the courts of that state or territory.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Your legal advisers should confirm the appropriate governing law and jurisdiction clauses, particularly if
              VeeSave will operate across multiple jurisdictions or through related entities.
